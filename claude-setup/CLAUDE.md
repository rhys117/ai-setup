# Claude Code Configuration

## MUST FOLLOW RULES
- NEVER commit to the `main` branch
- Complete changes on an appropriate feature branch (refer to deveopment procedure below)
- Commit changes often. Follow conventional commits pattern.

## Development Procedure
YOU NOW MUST IMMEDIATELY READ THE [DEVELOPMENT_PROCEDURE.md](.llms/DEVELOPMENT_PROCEDURE.md) FILE for the structured feature development workflow including:
- Plan file tracking (`.llms/.dev-plan-*.yaml`)
- Development process
- Working memory system (`.llms/dev-memory.json`)
- Tag management and search tools (`.llms/memory-search.js`)
- Size-based workflow mapping

WHEN MOVING ONTO THE NEXT STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURE YOU MUST:
- Re-Read the DEVELOPMENT_PROCEDURE.md file
- Verify that you do not need to revisit an earlier step
- Update the development plan
- announce that you're moving into the next step

## Project Overview
"Let Me Know" is a Ruby on Rails 8.0 event management and RSVP system.

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Ruby 3.2.2, Rails 8.0
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Turbo
- **Background Jobs**: GoodJob
- **Communications**: ClickSend (SMS), ActionMailer (Email)
- **AI Orchestration**: claude-flow (v1.0.72)
- **Containerization**: Docker with timestamped worktree isolation
- **Testing**: Use of rspec for testing

### Rails Commands (inside container)
```bash
bundle install        # Install Ruby dependencies
rails db:create       # Create database
rails db:migrate      # Run migrations
rails db:seed         # Seed database
rails server          # Start Rails server (port 3000 internal, 3050 external)
bundle exec rspec     # Run RSpec tests
```

## Code Style & Conventions

### Ruby/Rails Conventions
- Follow Rails 8.0 best practices
- Use strong parameters for all controllers
- Implement service objects in `app/services/` for complex business logic
- Use concerns for shared functionality
- Follow RESTful routing conventions
- Use Rails validations and callbacks appropriately

### Frontend Conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (no custom CSS unless necessary)
- Implement interactivity with Alpine.js
- Use Turbo for SPA-like navigation
- Follow BEM naming for custom components

### Database Conventions
- Always create indexes for foreign keys
- Use Rails migrations exclusively (never modify schema.rb directly)
- Always create migrations via the Rails generator, you may edit the migration file after creation
- NEVER modify ALREADY migrated migrations UNLESS you are rolling back the IMMEDIATE migration YOU have CREATED
- Follow Rails naming conventions for tables and columns
- Use appropriate PostgreSQL data types

### Testing Requirements
- Write tests for all new features
- Use RSpec for model and service specs
- Use RSpec system tests for integration testing
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Run tests before committing: `bundle exec rspec`

## Project Context

### Core Features
- Event creation and management
- RSVP collection and tracking
- Guest communication (SMS/Email)
- Seating arrangement management
- Vendor coordination
- Custom event theming

### Key Models
- `Event`: Core event entity
- `Guest`: Event participants
- `RSVP`: Guest responses
- `Communication`: SMS/Email logs
- `Vendor`: Service providers
- `SeatingArrangement`: Table assignments

### API Patterns
- RESTful JSON APIs under `/api/v1/`
- Use serializers for API responses
- Implement proper authentication/authorization
- Follow Rails API conventions

### Security Considerations
- Never commit credentials or secrets
- Use Rails credentials for sensitive data
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use CSRF protection for forms

### Ports
- 3000: Rails

### When Working on This Project
1. Always check existing patterns before implementing new features
2. Use Rails generators when appropriate
3. Follow TDD practices
4. Query memory for similar implementations: `node .llms/memory-search.js query "tags:topic"`
5. Check available tags before adding new ones: `node .llms/memory-search.js tags`
6. Maintain consistent code style with existing codebase
7. Run linters and tests before marking tasks complete
